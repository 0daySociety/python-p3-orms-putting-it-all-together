# Putting it All Together: ORMs Lab

## Learning Goals

- Create Python objects using SQL database records.
- Create SQL database records using Python objects.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**: a technique used to convert database
records into objects in an object-oriented language.

***

## Instructions

This is a **test-driven lab**. Run `pipenv install` to create your virtual
environment and `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment. Then run
`pytest -x` to run your tests. Use these instructions and `pytest`'s error
messages to complete your work in the `lib/` folder.

Instructions begin here:

- Make sure to specify any class, method, variable, module, package names
  that `pytest` will check for.
- Any other instructions go here.

Once all of your tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to
submit.
